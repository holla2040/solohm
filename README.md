Open Source Solar Panel Electronic Load

This project is a hardware/firmware design to aid in testing of solar panels. solohm is powered from the panel's output and an off-the-shelf lipo battery, it can load the panel at its maximum power point, WiFi UDP broadcast current and voltage readings packets, perform IV curve sweeps and measure many temperature of many panel locations. 

SolOhm replaces bulky expensive, AC-powered, non-waterproof, non-high-temperature rated, multi-unit, wired-communication test equipment with a single unit that's inexpensive, panel-powered, waterproof, industrial temperature rated, and wireless. The goal is 5 minute install: bolt SolOhm to your frame, connect your panel's + and - connectors, attach temperature probes and start testing.
